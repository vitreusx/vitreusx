### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jakub. I'm a grad student at the University of Warsaw, studying Machine Learning. Before that, I studied Computer Science at the same university. I'm interested in machine learning and data science in general, DevOps, scientific computing and functional programming, among other things.

My technical skills include:
- **Data science**: processing and analysis of data in Python and R, using libraries such as `pandas` and `sklearn`;
- **ML**: training and deployment of models in Tensorflow and PyTorch;
- **DevOps**: CI/CD with Gitlab CI and Github Actions, IaC with Terraform, configuration management with Ansible; general proficiency in using shell and Linux;
- **Scientific computing**: C++ programming with libraries such as Eigen, as well as writing CUDA kernels;
- **Functional programing** in Haskell and OCaml;
- **Mobile app development** with React Native;
- **Web dev**: frontend with Typescript and React, backend with Node and/or Python;
- **Databases**, both SQL (Postgres) and NoSQL (primarily MongoDB);
I'm also familiar with Java.
